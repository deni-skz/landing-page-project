<div class="cat-history">
    <h3 class="heading4">History of Cats</h3>
<p>Domestic cats fall into the ‘Felidae’ family, which can be split into three genera: 
<ul>
    <li>Panthera (lions, tigers, leopards, jaguars etc.)</li> 
    
    <li>Acinonyx (cheetah)</li>
    
    <li>Felis (‘small’ cats) </li>
</ul>
<br />
    Felis catus is the most recently evolved species within the Felidae family. Unlike other domesticated creatures, cats have historically contributed little to human survival, so scientists and researchers have often wondered how and why cats came to live amongst people. 
    
    <br />

    All cats evolved as apex predators making them excellent hunters, attributed to their keen senses of hearing, sight and smell. Felidae is the highest-developed, carnivorous (meat-eating) hunter of all mammals. Cats are generally solitary animals (excluding lions), able to hunt and fend for themselves in the wild. They’re territorial, marking out their territory mainly via scent.  </p>

    <p>
        While they aren’t considered to be man’s best friend, there are lots of reasons people choose to have cats as pets.  
<ul>
<li>Unlike dogs which require lots of attention and care, they are lower maintenance. No need to wash your cat or walk them outside (unless you choose to!) - they will take care of themselves. </li> 

<li>Despite their reputation for being aloof and moody, cats can be very affectionate with their owners. </li> 

<li>Studies have shown that owning a cat can reduce stress, anxiety, and even lower blood pressure.</li> 

<li>They are great companions for people who live alone or have a busy schedule. </li>
</ul> 
    </p>
